Hi there!

I'm not really sure where to start with an introduction, so let's start with some administrative information.

My name is Korben, I'm 18 years old, and I'm currently studying computer science athe UC Santa Cruz. I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/korbexmachina) if you are interested in my projects. If you want to chat with me, you can do so on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@korbexmachina:matrix.org). If you would like to reach out professionally, feel free to [email](mailto://contact@korbexmachina.com) me.

Now that we have the boring part out of the way, here's a few interesting facts about me:

- In my free time, I like to go mountain biking
- I was the co-captain of an improv comedy team during my freshman year of college.
- My favourite book is The Hobbit
- I'm afraid of spiders
- I absolutely love working with the Go programming language
