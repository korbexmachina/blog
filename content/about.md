Hi there!

I'm not sure how you ended up here, or what you might be interested in learning about me, but hopefully this is sufficient!

My name is Korben, I'm 19 years old, and I'm currently studying computer science at UC Santa Cruz. I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/korbexmachina) if you are interested in my projects. If you would like to reach out, feel free to [email](mailto:contact@korbexmachina.com) me.

Now that we have the boring part out of the way, here are a few facts about me:

- In my free time, I like to go mountain biking
- I was the co-captain of an improv comedy team during my freshman year of college
- I have a dog called Loki (feel free to contact me for cute pictures)
- ~~I'm afraid of spiders~~ I have a healthy respect for spiders

Thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet!
